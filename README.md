# csgo-xp-tracker

Program to track user's CS:GO XP progress in Discord

# How to use

 * Make sure you have python 3 installed.
 * Install the following pip packages: `csgo` `steam` `steamclient` `requests`.
 * Create a webhook for the channel you want updates in.
 * Rename `config.def.py` to `config.py` and change it to fit your needs.
 * Run `csgo-xp-tracker.py`. It will run a first time setup so you can add users to track.

If it crashes on launch, make sure to try [this fix](https://github.com/everlyy/csgo-xp-tracker/issues/2).
